# basic_angular

This basic angular CRUD app allows users to  get, add, delete, update heroes and villains to a database.

It also allows random heroes/villains to do battle based on their power level.

This app relies on our -- [basic rest api](https://github.com/mbuchthal/rest_api/tree/master/mark_buchthal)
